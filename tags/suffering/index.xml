Yes I know I know laugh away, I am too XD XD.
It was in my room playing with a string that was coming from my quilt. I was moving the quilt around trying to get it off the rat but he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give. Then I thought about killing the rat by kicking it as hard as I could with my boots.</description></item></channel></rss>
