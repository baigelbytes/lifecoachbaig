Yes I know I know laugh away, I am too XD XD.
It was in my room playing with a string that was coming from my quilt. I was moving the quilt around trying to get it off the rat but he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give. Then I thought about killing the rat by kicking it as hard as I could with my boots.</description></item><item><title>Why Muslims often get offended when you criticise their religion.</title><link>https://baigelbytes.github.io/lifecoachbaig/blog/religiousidentity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baigelbytes.github.io/lifecoachbaig/blog/religiousidentity/</guid><description>Some ideas for more respectful discussions. Introduction: I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching young atheists and x-Muslims debating Muslims for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a slight trend. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this happens when atheists and people of other faiths have debates but what happens is that whenever Islam is criticized as an ideology, even when they explicitly state they are not criticising any individuals that follow the faith but just the faith itself, Muslims inevitably get offended and often the atheist is labelled as an islamaphobe.</description></item></channel></rss>
