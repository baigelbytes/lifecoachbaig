Introduction: I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching young atheists and x-Muslims debating Muslims for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a slight trend. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this happens when atheists and people of other faiths have debates but what happens is that whenever Islam is criticized as an ideology, even when they explicitly state they are not criticising any individuals that follow the faith but just the faith itself, Muslims inevitably get offended and often the atheist is labelled as an islamaphobe.</description></item></channel></rss>
