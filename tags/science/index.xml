As the name sugguests this series deals with topics I either partially or completely don&amp;rsquo;t understand or that are so mind blowing that I find them hard to wrap my head around. Hopefully your brains don&amp;rsquo;t get completely fried XD. Enjoy :)
Are you ready to have your mind blown? Our entire universe could be the 3 dimensional surface of a four dimensional hypersphere!</description></item><item><title>Arguments for the possibility of a created universe.</title><link>https://baigelbytes.github.io/lifecoachbaig/blog/deismpossible/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://baigelbytes.github.io/lifecoachbaig/blog/deismpossible/</guid><description>Why I think scientists and atheists shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say there can&amp;rsquo;t be a God or that there definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t one. Introduction: One thing that religious people often say is &amp;lsquo;There just has to be a creator&amp;rsquo;. Atheists will be quick to point out that this isn&amp;rsquo;t technically true. But some atheists commit the same mistake when they (sometimes proudly) proclaim that their is no god or that nothing happens after we die besides us going into the ground and our bodies getting eaten by insects.</description></item></channel></rss>
