<h2 id=the-story>The Story:</h2>
<p>So I had a nightmare about a giant rat. Yes I know I know laugh away, I am too XD XD.</p>
<p>It was in my room playing with a string that was coming from my quilt. I was moving the quilt around trying to get it off the rat but he wouldn&rsquo;t give. Then I thought about killing the rat by kicking it as hard as I could with my boots.</p>
<p>Yes, I was still in bed, never got out of it or put anything on but for some reason I now magically had boots on my feet. I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to do it. Eventually though the rat lost interest and let the quilt go so I pulled the quilt back onto my bed. Then the rat started pulling on the string again.</p>
<p>This time, still lying down, I kicked the quilt up in an attempt to move the string up onto the bed but in doing so the rat also ended up on the bed UNDER MY FOOT!!!!! My foot was now on top of the rat as if it were a foot rest!!! I didn&rsquo;t have boots on anymore either.</p>
<p>So there I was, still in the nightmare with this giant (roughly half the size of your avarage house cat. I could have done with a cat about then!) rat still under my foot!</p>
<p>It was still alive as I could feel it breathing as well as it&rsquo;s horrible greasy fur. But as I tried to move my foot away in order to kick the rat off the bed something strange happened.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t move my legs!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how many of you know about sleep paralysis but briefly it&rsquo;s a feature of sleep that prevents most of us from moving in the real world when we move around in a dream. This happens I assume, because sleepwalking around the African Savannah as an early human would have likely turned you into a nice tasty lion snack.</p>
<p>Well, this time, the sleep paralysis of real life was happening in the nightmare! I couldn&rsquo;t move my feet in the nightmare because of it. This scared me even more. To the point where it actually woke me up. As I was waking up though I started to gain movement back in my legs both in real life and in the nightmare.</p>
<p>I ended up kicking the corner of the desk at the foot of my bed (in real life) which hurt a little but at least I didn&rsquo;t stub my toe. I frantically looked around at the foot of my bed as if the rat was actually real. Obviously it wasn&rsquo;t. Thank God, Yahweh, Zeus, Chris Hemsworth and Posidon! XD</p>
<p>But this got me thinking about the nature of suffering at least to a small degree. There I was in my room, awake from a nightmare that at the time of experiencing it I would have personally labelled as suffering.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just it. Was it really suffering? There was no rat in real life, it was literally &ldquo;just a nightmare&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id=suffering-objective-or-relative>Suffering, objective or relative?</h2>
<p>Real suffering would be more like suffering domestic abuse or being in a war zone or being robbed. I had an opinion once in my days as a teenager that &ldquo;All suffering is relative&rdquo; I said this to a colleague at work back then. He was shocked and perhaps even offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can ALL suffering be relative!&rdquo; He almost shouted, &ldquo;How can you say something like a paper cut is the same as being raped or killed!?!??&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He was right obviously. Those were not the same things at all, not even remotely close.</p>
<p>But this morning, after the nightmare it made me ask that same question again. Is suffering relative? Let&rsquo;s do a thought experiment. Think of suffering not as what is done to us or what we experience but instead as how we react to it. In other words, I&rsquo;m proposing that suffering might be something that is actually relative to a person&rsquo;s own perspective and how they respond to it.</p>
<p>For instance, to a child, finding out that Santa Claus isn&rsquo;t real is probably something they would classify as suffering, but to an adult it&rsquo;s just not that much of a big deal. By stark contrast a soilder for example would likely have experienced so many examples of suffering in the hell of war that it would make anyone else wonder how they manage to stay sane after coming back to the countries they fought to protect.</p>
<p>While there are without doubt an almost infinite number of varying degrees by which suffering and harm can be inflicted upon people, unless people are being hospitalised or killed, how people react to it is, at least some of the time something they could potentially control.</p>
<p>Feel free to disagree with me, I&rsquo;m not making any scientific or factual claims and I did no research for this article beyond finding the two videos I&rsquo;ve listed blow which I think help to illustrate the point I&rsquo;m trying to make.</p>
<p>Beyond that, this article is purely an opinion piece and should be taken as such.</p>
<h3 id=the-1st-video>The 1st video:</h3>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/Yf-JGGLxNew>The first video</a> is a child that you may have seen on social media who was crying profusely, thinking he was going to drown. He was holding onto a rope that was strung above the waters surface, from his perspective, for dear life.</p>
<p>Then, someone who I assume was his older sister grabbed his legs and put them under water to show him that the water was actually shallow enough for him to stand without even coming close to drowning.</p>
<p>In the video you can see his delightfully funny reaction:</p>
<p><a href=https://youtu.be/Yf-JGGLxNew>https://youtu.be/Yf-JGGLxNew</a></p>
<h3 id=the-2nd-video>The 2nd video:</h3>
<p>Now, in a very stark contrast <a href=https://youtu.be/MB786dkSx48>the second video</a> is of a Bhuddist monk who was holding a protest by (trigger warning!) burning himself to death! Try to remember the last time you touched a hot plate out of the microwave or a pan on the cooker, how did you react?</p>
<p>Well, this guy literally didn&rsquo;t even flinch! He literally just sat there in the street, meditating while another monk calmly poured petrol around and over him then, he proceeded to light himself on fire and then continue meditating. Now I&rsquo;m not condoning his actions, there are far better ways to protest that don&rsquo;t require killing yourself or harming anyone at all!</p>
<p>But you can see in the video, he literally doesn&rsquo;t flinch once and then his body just falls back as he dies:</p>
<p><em>An animated video explaining what happened if you&rsquo;d rather not see the real thing.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the one you will have been taken to if you already clicked the hyperlink above in the first paragraph of this subsection:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://youtu.be/MB786dkSx48>https://youtu.be/MB786dkSx48</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The actual video, massive trigger warning though. DO NOT WATCH THIS if you don&rsquo;t want to see a man die on camera!</em></p>
<p>(YouTube also gives a warning that the content has been identified as inappropriate or offensive by the YouTube community but you can still watch it if you tap &lsquo;confirm&rsquo;.)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://youtu.be/ZwQTsCiguHc>https://youtu.be/ZwQTsCiguHc</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, these two people were having vastly different experiences but reacted in two completely different ways! I think any normal person at just the thought of being burnt alive would have quite a strong reaction but something tells me that if we could interview that monk today, he might not have labelled it as suffering to him.</p>
<p>As for the boy I think his opinion might be similar to my opinion of my nightmare i.e, it felt like suffering at the time but then realised really, it wasn&rsquo;t. So what I&rsquo;m saying is in my opinion, suffering can soetimes be relative to an individual&rsquo;s perspective and their reaction not necessarily the experience itself.</p>
<p>This has implications for people in the real world and shares similarities with other philosophies like stoicism and similar components of various religions. It&rsquo;s almost certain that you will experience hardship and suffering in your life multiple, multiple times and off course there are different degrees of harm that can be inflicted upon us both by other people and ourselves, but how we react to that can sometimes make all the difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, about perspective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end with a quote from Seneca an ancient Roman philosopher and stoic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more in imagination than in reality."</em> - Seneca</p>
