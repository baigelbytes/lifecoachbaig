<h2 id=help-me-turn-this-into-a-career>Help me turn this into a career.</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to do blogging and life coaching full time without the need for a 9-5 because <strong>this</strong> is where my passions lie!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to write books many times before at different points in my life but my interests have always shifted from one subject to another. Blogging is perfect for this as I can literally write about any subject I like.</p>
<p>Additionally, after spending almost 6 years in the corporate world I can say without a doubt that it is not for me! There were some really good times in the early years but at some companies I&rsquo;ve both wittnesed and heard too much about how people get treated in those worlds<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, I want to have a career where I get to help people in a <strong>much</strong> larger capacity than just resetting their passwords or getting their internet working.</p>
<p>This is what led me to life coaching. It actually enables me to work with clients to completely transform their lives while working from anywhere I like which means I wont be locked into living in one place because of work.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to help me turn this into a profession then there are three ways you could help:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>You can send me money via my <a href="https://paypal.me/baigelbytes?locale.x=en_GB">paypal link</a>.</em> (You&rsquo;ll need a <a href=https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/account-selection>paypal account</a> for this.)</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a <a href="https://paypal.me/baigelbytes?locale.x=en_GB">paypal account</a> for the blog and you can use this link to send me any amount of money you like, however small it will be immensly apreciated!!!</p>
<p><a href="https://paypal.me/baigelbytes?locale.x=en_GB">paypal.me/baigelbytes</a></p>
<ol start=2>
<li><em>You can send me money via my <a href="https://monzo.me/mirzabaig6?d=Thank%20you%20so%20much%20for%20your%20support!!">monzo.me</a> link.</em> (You do not need to have a monzo account for this.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that the monzo link does not let you send payments of less than £1 or from credit or prepaid cards. You can however send £1 or more using debit cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://monzo.me/mirzabaig6?d=Thank%20you%20so%20much%20for%20your%20support!!">monzo.me/mirzabaig6</a></p>
<ol start=3>
<li><em>Sign up to my <a href=https://baigelbytes.github.io/lifecoachbaig/lifecoaching/>life coaching</a>.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to get something back for your money then I&rsquo;d higly reccomend you sign up for my <a href=https://baigelbytes.github.io/lifecoachbaig/lifecoaching/>life coaching services</a>. I have many different options available including individual one off sessions and monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look at my <a href=https://baigelbytes.github.io/lifecoachbaig/lifecoaching/>life coaching page</a> to see if its for you.</p>
<p>Also, if you donate money either as a one off or over multiple individual payments that add up to the value of any of my services you can send me an email showing me this is the case and sign up for any applicable life coaching services you like.</p>
<p>For example, if you give £10 a month for 5 months, and then send me an email showing the payments you made, you can sign up for a one hour session at no extra cost. This essentially allows you to save up for sessions if you can&rsquo;t afford them outright.</p>
<p>Payments for my life coaching services can be taken by bank transfer or via either of the methods listed above.</p>
<h2 id=why-dont-i-just-use-ads>Why don&rsquo;t I just use ads?</h2>
<p><strong>Because I hate ads!!</strong> Everytime I go on any website these days I have to fight through entire battalians and armies of adverts. Some sites have so many that you can hardly see the actual content.</p>
<p>Then, perhaps worst of all, there are these slide show pages where, instead of just giving you the content the title promised they send you through slide after slide after slide of insubstansial nonsense.</p>
<p>Each individual slide is constantly baraging you with new ads until finally (if you don&rsquo;t give up that is), after what feels like a life times worth of struggling you get to the last slide, you are yet still made to feel like a celebrity cocain addict getting followed around by the marketing paparatzi!!</p>
<p>I get that people are trying to make a living, that&rsquo;s exaclty what I&rsquo;m trying to do but there&rsquo;s just no need to post THAT MANY ads on every area of every website. It&rsquo;s even infiltrating operating systems now as windows 10 users get ads right in the OS! Just one of the many reasons why I personally prefer GNU/Linux.</p>
<h3 id=not-on-my-site>NOT ON MY SITE!!</h3>
<p>I purposfully chose services that allowed me to build a minimalist site from providers that do not require me to force advertising on my sites visitors and that do not require me to persue profiting from collecting users data and selling it to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>I built this site with Hugo, a static website builder, and I host it as an open source project on github because I care about peoples privacy and the quality of both my own and other peoples digital lifes.</p>
<p>If I ever do use ads, they will live on their own separate page and not spread like a cancer across the rest of the site and social media following people around like some deranged stalker.</p>
<p>Obviously though, I&rsquo;d like to be able to avoid using ads alltogether and if I want to run this blog and do life coaching full time (and OH BOY DO I!!) then it will be by the generosity of readers like you and people that sign up to my life coaching!</p>
<p>I fully understand if you are not in a position to give anything and also if you simply don&rsquo;t want to and that&rsquo;s fine! I&rsquo;m not trying to force any money from anyone. If all you ever want to do is read my posts that&rsquo;s fine! If you don&rsquo;t want to read my posts then that&rsquo;s fine to!</p>
<p>Do whats best for you!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help anyone ends up giving and I wish all of you, regardless of whether you support my work or not all the very best in your own endevours!! :)</p>

<p>I know not all companies are like this but the rate at which the trend is growing is increasing at a frightening pace!! There was one company I worked for that actually sacked a worker on the day of their mothers funeral! Thats simply an industry that I <strong>DO NOT</strong> want to work in any more!!!!!!!!!&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
